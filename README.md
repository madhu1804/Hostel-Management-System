# Hostel-Management-System
The Main agenda for this project is I have actually built a fully-flexible Hostel Management System, in such a way that it contains all the relevant and important data concerned with a Hostel. This System keeps track of all the details, starting from hostel block, to each furniture in the room of each of the hostel blocks. It doesnâ€™t contain any ambiguous entities, which makes it a flexible one.I have included several foreign key constraints, which binds together the relations. Here, in this project, we have included 10 relations, all related and applicable to hostel or other similar institutions. Here,I have managed to complete our project using only SQL Plus.
